   <h3> Short Biography:</h3>
  
   <p>This is <strong class="text-coloring">Malek Shafi’I</strong>.
  I'm director and funder of <em>Afghanistan International Human Rights Film Festival</em>. I am also filmmaker, director, producer, editor, consultant. I studied sociology in Afghanistan, and I had two years professional courses in cinema in Tehran, and participated to many workshops and residency programs in the USA (I was <em>IVLP</em> fellow in 2009), and some other countries. I worked as jury member for numerous national and international film festivals and wrote some article for BBCP, and some other printed and online media networks.<br> I made several movies about refugees since 1999. I travelled to different countries, documenting the life of refugees while myself was also a refugee.   
  I established <em>Kabul Film Festival</em> and <em><a href="https://unama.unmissions.org/second-afghanistan-human-rights-film-festival-ends-awards-and-prizes-ceremony">Afghanistan Human Rights Film Festival</a></em>, and did a lot of other projects. During past 18 years I organized several workshops about <em>human rights</em>, screened more than a thousand human rights movies from all around the glob to Afghan and foreign audiences in Kabul and some other provinces. I also invited many independent filmmakers and human rights activists, mostly from the region, to Kabul to learn and to share their ideas with a broader audiance.<br>  I also worked as senior advisor for <em>National TV and Radio of Afghanistan</em> and as coordinator with some <em>UN</em> projects.  In this period of time I build a strong network with human rights activists, mostly with artists, and hold some workshops in some film festivals about dealing with censorship, and security.
   </p>
   <p>Since 2016 I live in Copenhagen.<br>
